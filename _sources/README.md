**Welcome to NCAR Dask Tutorial!**

**Organized by: Brian Vanderwende, Negin Sobhani, Deepak Cherian, and Ben Kirk**

The materials and notebooks in this tutorial is published as a Jupyter book here. [![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](https://ncar.github.io/dask-tutorial/README.html)

Here you will find the tutorial materials from the CISL/CSG Dask Tutorial. 
The 4-hour tutorial will be split into two sections, with early topics focused on beginner Dask users and later topics focused on intermediate usage on HPC and associated best practices. 

This tutorial is open to non-UCAR staff. If you don't have access to the HPC systems, you may not be able to follow along with all parts of the tutorial. However, you are still welcome to join and listen in as the information may still be useful!

Video Recoding: Will be available after the event

## ‚å®Ô∏è Getting set up

This tutorial is open to non-UCAR staff. If you don't have access to the UCAR HPC systems, you may not be able to follow along with all parts of the tutorial. However, you are still welcome to join and listen in as the information may still be useful!

### [NCAR JupyterHub](https://github.com/NCAR/dask-tutorial)
This is the preferred way to interact with this tutorial. Users with access to Casper can run the notebooks interactively, and will be able to save their work and pull in new updates.
To connect to NCAR JupyterHub, please open this link in a web browser: https://jupyterhub.hpc.ucar.edu/

Next, clone the repository to your local directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/NCAR/dask-tutorial
```
Finally, open the notebooks and interact with them. Make sure to choose the "NPL 2023a" kernel.

### Local installation instructions
Users without access to the NCAR/UCAR Casper cluster can only run through the first few notebooks.
To run the notebooks locally:

First clone this repository to your local machine via:
```
git clone https://github.com/NCAR/dask-tutorial
```

Next, download conda (if you haven't already)

If you do not already have the conda package manager installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#install).

Now, create a conda environment:

Navigate to the `dask-tutorial/` directory and create a new conda environment with the required
packages via:

```terminal
cd dask-tutorial
conda env update --file environment.yml
```

This will create a new conda environment named "dask-tutorial".

Next, activate the environment:

```
conda activate dask-tutorial
```

Finally, launch JupyterLab with:

```
jupyter lab
```
