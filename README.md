**Welcome to NCAR Dask Tutorial!**

**Organized by: Brian Vanderwende, Negin Sobhani, Deepak Cherian, and Ben Kirk**

The materials and notebooks in this tutorial is published as a Jupyter book here. [![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](https://tutorial.xarray.dev)

Here you will find the tutorial materials from the CISL/CSG Dask Tutorial. 
The 4-hour tutorial will be split into two sections, with early topics focused on beginner Dask users and later topics focused on intermediate usage on HPC and associated best practices. 

This tutorial is open to non-UCAR staff. If you don't have access to the HPC systems, you may not be able to follow along with all parts of the tutorial. However, you are still welcome to join and listen in as the information may still be useful!

Video Recoding: Will be available after the event
